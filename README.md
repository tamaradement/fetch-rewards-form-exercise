### Requirements
1) Display a form with inputs for each of the following fields: [X]
  - Name
  - Email
  - Password
  - Occupation
  - State
2) Allow a user to complete and submit the form. [X]
3) Do not allow form submission without completing the entire form. [X]
4) Provide feedback upon successful form submission [X]

### Implemented bonus features:
1) Added form validation with specific error messaging for each field input.
2) Added an async loader, to cue the user when a request is in progress, i.e. form submission, data loading.

### Ideas for additional features:
1) Implement custom dropdowns. (Replace HTML select element.)
2) Additional rules for password validation.
3) Formatting for mobile screen sizes.

### Notes
1) Considered using a form library (i.e. formik or react-form-hook) but opted not to in order to showcase my ability to handle error messaging on my own.
